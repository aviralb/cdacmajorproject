About a McKinsey Company

A McKinsey Company is an advanced-analytics McKinsey 
team operating at the intersection of strategy, technology and design to improve performance outcomes for organizations.
In 2015 QuantumBlack became part of McKinsey & Company. Together we combine our advanced analytics, 
design and engineering expertise with McKinsey’s industry knowledge and organizational change management experience. 
QuantumBlack was born and proven in Formula 1 – where teams live and breathe data. Today, we are still fascinated by how a
marginal gain can have a significant impact on the performance of any organization. Learn more about QuantumBlack, a McKinsey
